## Background

The game begins with you on another journey to find the quietest place to swim deep within the unknown parts of space. All of a sudden a warning pops up. A scheduled, forced software update which goes horribly wrong. As you scramble to avoid disaster, your ship is forced to make an emergency landing on a random planet close by. After a safe automated landing, the ships reception disconnects from the server and you have to attach your external antenna to the ship for the update to proceed. You finally manage to pop in the antenna but when you think youâ€™re back in control, Chris Hanson, bird-like creature, swoops in and steals the antenna right before he mocks you.

Since you had made your emergency landing in someone's farm. An ugly man approaches you. Stunning you with his breath and ugliness. He also gives you a map that points to where that birdlike creature lies, next to his master Blarbazorp. Your journey to recover the antenna and find your way home begins. Along the way, youâ€™ll uncover the planet's tragic history and decide whether to help its inhabitants or focus solely on your escape.


## Objective
Although this story starts in mid space most of it takes place on an eccentric, forsaken planet deep in the galaxy. Once a bustling hub of trade and technology, now a chaotic wasteland. The once-thriving society has crumbled, largely due to the actions of a ruthless overlord, Blarbazop, who steals and hoards everyone's resources with the assistance of his pet/henchman Chris Hansen a mischievous bird-like creature who causes trouble for everyoneâ€”especially you, the player.

The planetâ€™s landscape is as bizarre as its inhabitants. Alien slums litter the surface, where creatures scrape by, selling oddities in decrepit markets. Majestic but deteriorating, mountains loom in the distance, covering ruins of the planetâ€™s former glory. In the heart of this planet stands Blarbazopâ€™s mansion, a fortress of wealth where he holds his stolen treasure. So that's where you as the main player will be heading to. To take back whats yours.


## Main Characters

**The Protagonist (Player Character):** You are a space traveler who gets stranded on a forsaken planet. With a sarcastic and sharp-tongued personality, you navigate this absurd planet in search of your stolen antenna. Your main goal is to fix your ship and get off the planet, but along the way, youâ€™ll encounter unexpected challenges and opportunities.

**Chris Hanson (The Bird Thief):** Introduced initially as Jock Bird, Chris Hanson is a winged creature who taunts and steals from anyone and everyone. Though seemingly mischievous, he is far more than just a petty thief. He's Blarbazop's henchman, Chris plays a pivotal role in keeping the planetâ€™s residents poor and miserable. His snide comments and unpredictable behavior make him a constant thorn in your side.

**Blarbazop (The Boss):** The ultimate antagonist, Blarbazop is an evil and greedy overlord who rules the planet with an iron fist. Through his manipulation and hoarding, he has thrown the entire planet into ruin, keeping its inhabitants weak and desperate. He hides away in his mansion, surrounded by wealth and power, while the rest of the planet crumbles. He has something that belongs to you. Blarbazopâ€™s downfall becomes not just your mission to escape, but the key to liberating the planet.

**Ugly Man:** A local alien farmer with a face thatâ€™s, well, hard to look at. Despite his appearance and bad breath, Ugly Man is one of the friendliest and most helpful characters you meet. After some really bad directions he actually gives you a map that leads you to Blarbazop's mansion.

## Development

**Difficulties of Arvin:**
Of course, I had a rough idea of what my code needed for the mapping system in this game. The challenges really started after I had written the basic class code with its getters and setters. I was aiming for something functional at first that I could build on later. But I did run into a few issues, and here's what they were and how overcame them:

Indexing Issues: I initially set the player's starting position at (0, 0), which landed them in the top-left cornerâ€”far from the actual starting point of the game. To fix it, I set the default starting position to (3, 4) so the player starts from next to the bottom-right corner where "Start" was planned to be.

Movement Challenges: The movement mechanics were tricky. At first, I had a hard time keeping the player from moving out of bounds or into empty spaces. I solved it by adding two checks: one to make sure the input was a valid direction, and another to ensure the player stays within the grid and doesn't walk into obstacles.

Marking Player's Position: Initially, the only way the player knew their position was from a printout of the location's name, and it wasn't clear enough. So, I added a condition to mark their position with an "X", ensuring it wouldnâ€™t mess up the rest of the grid display.

Filling Empty Spaces: I started by using a simple "-" to represent empty spaces, but it didnâ€™t look right to me. After some quick research, I remembered I could use emojis in code, so I went with the tree emoji ðŸŒ² to make it visually clear which areas were unwalkable.

Compass Alignment: Aligning the compass with the map rows took a bit of trial and error. I eventually figured it out by integrating the compass printing into the iteration method that prints the map line by line.
 

Collabiration: Working with my coleagues was great as we communicated and voted for ideas building the game. The incorporation of the code into the main file was difficult specially since a lot of the other functions also relied on it. I had to write the plyrMove,gameMenu function so the user could choose to move or access the map and inventory, I tinkered with the welcome function, I renamed and separated the startGame into startgame and intro so i could call them separately and also trounleshoot later if needed. The back and forth was difficult as we all troubleshooted our code and tied everything in together.






**Difficulties of Nikki:**
I wanted the combat mechanics to have 3 functions, attack, sneak, and use item. I originally intended for special attacks, however I was unsure of where it would fit into the story, so I scrapped it. So it left me with this skeleton code structure:
if player picks 1:
fight sequence happens, player damages enemy
if player picks 2:
1/3 chance of sneaking away
if player picks 3:
choose from an inventory of items (if possible) to use
it becomes enemy's turn and vice versa

Attack Mechanism Issues:
I wanted to allow for certain aliens to have different attack times, to spice up the gameplay a bit. I originally branched off and added a seperate attackTime variable  within the Alien subclass, however, since the combat mechanism used the parent class Character as a parameter, I figured it would be easier to derive the attackTime variable from setting it to turnsToAttack in the initial stage. I fiddled around before settling that the AttackTime should be declared in the combat code, before any fight sequence has happened to ensure that the variable does not change. 

Debugging issues:
I wanted to ensure that anyone who tried to input something other than the numbers specified would still be able to run the combat sequence, in case of a mistype. So I surrounded by code with try: catch. However, I found that the while loop did not work as intended, as I originally had the while loop inside the try sequence. I was able to fix it by putting the while loop first. 

Sneak Chance challenges:
I wanted to introduce a certain random percentage that activates when you try to use the sneak function. So I thought of using the random number generator to achieve this. The random number generator picks a number from 1-3, and if that number lands on 1, then you have successfully snuck away.

Main function challenges:
It was mainly hard to figure out the right pacing for the game, although I don't believe it is perfect. I think it is playable with this text pacing. I wanted the text to slowly print out characters, like the ones you see in actual story games. So I figured out a way to slowly print out characters by writing the DPO function, which takes in the string input and outputs it by the specified amount of milliseconds in the function. I accomplished this by utilising the sleep function in Java. I also used that same function to provide spacing between dialogues.

As I was writing my code, I noticed that I was using the text box too often, so I figured i might as well write a function for it. This was not too hard to do, as I didn't really think about the logic behind it, more so got the result through trial and error. But essentially I got the function to return a framed word through slowly constructing the String with for loops. 

The rest of the code, mainly consisting of dialogue and descriptions, wasn't that hard to implement. I added the dialogue options and little comments of where my groupmates should add in their functions after a certain dialogue is pressed (such as 1 - climb mountain). So it mainly consisted of copying and pasting the text that we agreed upon in one of our group meetings.






**Difficulties of Minh:**
Inventory
I aimed to make the Inventory System have a kind of functionality that would give the player the majority of what they would need that involved an inventory such as collecting items, dropping items when inventory is full, and displaying the inventory when traveling or in battle. The way I approached developing the inventory system was by first thinking of the best functions and tools to suit the requirements for the code, which I had a rough understanding of how to do. Stuff like using an ArrayList to store all the items in one place, creating a method to add items to the inventory while it still isn't at full capacity, a method to remove items from the inventory when trying to add items at full capacity, and a method to print out a simple display of what the player currently has in their inventory which uses a simple "for loop" to print a certain amount of time in relation to however many index values are currently in place in the ArrayList.

Issues:
A lot of the issues I had with the inventory was figuring out how I would implement it into a fully functional system while still in the early development of the game. Of course, I had a pretty clear image of what my inventory system would be like, but even then most of my struggles came from doubting what I could do with the limited knowledge I have in terms of coding. While creating the code of the Inventory I ran through a lot of complications like having trouble with making the inventory display items in a certain order which was originally discussed with my fellow group members with having weapons always allocated to the first inventory slot and having other items allocated below them. In the end, we later discussed not continuing further with that function. From the beginning, my inventory system was extremely simple and only added and displayed items as a simple creation of an Array List where it would ask the user to type in the name of an item and it would print it out once 5 items were entered. Later on, I had struggles with implementing an adding to inventory feature due to having difficulties in making items in the Main file accessible to the Inventory File as well as being in the early stages of development where it was difficult to determine which bits of the code would require the inventory function in which was basically creating an adding function blindly without anything in the main file to allow for me to test yet. Eventually, I had a clearer picture of the code where I could see where my implementation could be put and in which way I could code it to fit appropriately to what is needed. The last struggle I had in terms of just the Inventory was for the majority of the time working on the project, I had many struggles with fixing errors with my code overlapping the majority of things which most I could not pinpoint which took up a lot of my time in troubleshooting and looking over lines of codes to see any possible fixes that can benefit me. I cleared a few things up towards the end and everything seems stable.

MerchantSystem
The merchant to me was my biggest obstacle for this project. For the merchant, I envisioned having it so that the player would be able to interact with the merchant, see what the merchant had for sale, and for the player to be able to make purchases. I wouldn't say I had the greatest image of what would be needed to be done to achieve what I envisioned but I slowly worked up to having a decent idea the more I drafted it out over time. The way I approached developing the Merchant System for our game was by first determining what functions, tools, and methods I would need to best suit the criteria of what we needed in a merchant. Things like creating a class to store what item the merchant was selling using an ArrayList, a method to print out a simple display of what the merchant currently had for sale which uses a simple "for loop" to print a certain amount of time in relation to however many index values are currently in place in the ArrayList for the merchant, a method to check to see if the player meets the requirements to buy a certain item from the merchant by searching through the player's current inventory for what is needed to fulfill a trade with the merchant through a boolean, a method for the player to enter the number that corresponds to the item they wish to buy using the Index values of the merchant's inventory (the items they are selling), and a method to remove the traded items for both the player and merchant as well as adding the item the player purchased from the merchant into their current inventory.

Issues:
The majority of my issues came from me simply struggling to figure out how I was going to implement it into our code with it being my first time coding in Java and my coding knowledge being very limited or having most of the content from this unit being difficult to understand in a logical sense personally. While creating the code for the merchant system, I ran into multiple complications in a various amount of time. Althought most times I would overthink situations and almost always jeopardize my work for doing so. Things like being unable to define the InventorySystem file in MerchantSystem code which was quite crucial to perform the trading function that was required for the merchant to work, unable to get my methods for adding and removing items as well as checking for trading/purchase requirements being met to function without errors due to constant difficulties with the Main file being unable to recognize or define what and where the merchant code was even after constant logical and syntax changes and still being determined as undefined or unresolvable. Another issue I tackled with was trying to figure out how I would have gold in our game since my group and I had planned for the player to be able to obtain gold from defeating enemies as a form of currency. After multiple attempts for drafting and envisioning a way to implement it into our game, towards the end we discussed and came to an agreement to not go forward with a currency system but rather have the player purchase items from the merchant with an item, like a trade-off. The remaining of my issues were minor issues that required monitoring and touch-ups the more we progressed in our project as a group with most taking up huge chunks of time troubleshooting and pinpointing potential faults or roadblocks in the lines of our code.

Overall
Overall, working on this project with my group members Arvin and Nikki has been a total pleasure. Collaboratively working with them has been a very open space to discuss various ideas and share our opinions. Arvin and Nikki have been such supportive group members with being able to see through my struggles and share advice and potential solutions on how I could approach my work differently. We were able to have an extremely productive meeting with each other to mainly draft out a great storyline and dialogue for our game to make it full of storytelling and also some humor. Since most of our functions relied on one another, collaborating with my group members has made working on this project a smooth sailing experience for most or at least half of it.
